README WeBe Bloggin
-------------------------
Create a blog engine. Users need to be able to log in. Only logged in users can create, edit, or delete posts.


Posts are written in Markdown. They're displayed like on any blog -- reverse sequential order. They should be paginated, so if you have more than X posts -- 10 is a good number, so is 7, decide for yourself -- there are multiple pages, and some navigation at the bottom of the page to go to the previous or next set of posts.


Posts have a show view where you can just see that post. On the show view, there should be a comment form so you can leave comments. Comments should be shown on the page. Logged in users should be able to delete comments.

API Use
------------------------
You can retrieve a page's information through the api directory

If you were viewing the webpage at localhost:3000/users/1
    Navigating to "localhost:3000/api/users/1" would retrieve json

You can Create (POST), Update(PATCH/PUT), Destroy(DELETE) any type of Record(Users, Entries, Comments)
    Example through curl "curl -X POST --data "comment[name]=Commenter&comment[description]=Description" http://localhost:3000/api/entries/:id/comments"

You must pass the API key as a parameter to Create Entries, or to Update or Delete any record.
    To retrieve your API token. Log in and click the link "API Token" in the top nav bar.
    Example "curl -X PATCH --data "comment[name]=Commenter&comment[description]=Updated Description&api_token=Your API token here" http://localhost:3000/api/comments/:id"
            "curl -X DELETE --data "api_token=Your API token here" http://localhost:3000/api/entries/:id"
            "curl -X POST --data "entry[title]=API Made Post&entry[description]=API Made Description&api_token=Your API token here" http://localhost:3000/api/entries"
