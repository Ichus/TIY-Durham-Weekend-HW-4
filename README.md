README WeBe Bloggin
-------------------------
Create a blog engine. Users need to be able to log in. Only logged in users can create, edit, or delete posts.


Posts are written in Markdown. They're displayed like on any blog -- reverse sequential order. They should be paginated, so if you have more than X posts -- 10 is a good number, so is 7, decide for yourself -- there are multiple pages, and some navigation at the bottom of the page to go to the previous or next set of posts.


Posts have a show view where you can just see that post. On the show view, there should be a comment form so you can leave comments. Comments should be shown on the page. Logged in users should be able to delete comments.
